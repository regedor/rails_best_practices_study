<p> 
  It seams an obvious assumption. Although, it requires formal proof.<br />
  The objective of this project is to find a correlation, between projects quality and best practices.<br />
  This study is the support for <a href="https://github.com/regedor/Master-Thesis">my master thesis</a>.
  The <span style="color:red">on development</span> pdf version of it can be downloaded 
  <a href="https://github.com/regedor/Master-Thesis/raw/master/Thesis/thesis.pdf">here</a>.

<h2>About this project source code</h2>
<div id="about-soucecode">
  <p> 
	Well, the code is open source.
	By looking at it, you will realize that it is a simple Ruby on Rails application.
	The application presents a single page where you can enter one or more links to github projects (Rails applications).
	The links are stored in the database and in parallel a demon should be running (delayed job).
	The purpose of this process is to check for new links on the database,
	use them to clone the projects repositories, retrieve github details, 
	run ruby_best_practices gem upon them and store everything in the database.
	
  </p>

  <h3>Dependencies</h2>
  <p>
	The project consists of a regular Rails application, 
    Its dependencies are listed in the Gemfile. The only uncommon thing is the need to use my altered version of the 
	<a href="https://github.com/flyerhzm">Richard Huang</a> gem: 
	<a href="https://github.com/regedor/rails_best_practices/tree/bp_study">rails_best_practices</a>

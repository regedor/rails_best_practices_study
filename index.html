<div class="description">by following best practices, a project's maintainability is increased.</div>

<p>It seems an obvious assumption, although it requires formal proof.</p>
<p>The objective of this project is to find a correlation between a project's quality and its usage of best practices.</p>

<p>
  Rails Best Practices Study is a tool 
  (<a href="http://app.study.gorgeouscode.com/">demo</a>) 
  serving of support for my 
  <a href="/2013/03/master-thesis/">Master's thesis</a>.

<h2>About the tool</h2>
<div id="about-soucecode">
  <p>
	The tool is open source and the source code hosted on github.
	It consists of a Ruby on Rails application with two main parts:
  </p><p>
	The first part is a web interface where you can enter one or more links to github projects (Rails applications). 
	The links are stored in the database for later processing. 
	After concluded the assessment of a project, the report and best practices score is presented in this same web interface.
  </p><p>	
	The second part is the a daemon that should be running in paralel (delayed job). 
	The purpose of this process is to check for new links on the database, 
	use them to clone the projects repositories, retrieve github details, 
	run the analyses based on the <span class="code">ruby_best_practices</span> gem upon them and store the report in the database.
  </p><p>
    Anyone is free to download this project and use without any limitations.
    A online instance of the tool (demo) is also available 
    <a href="http://app.study.gorgeouscode.com/">here</a>.
    However at this moment, the daemon is only running once a week 
    (this happens to avoid <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">heroku</a> hosting costs).	
  </p>

  <h3>Dependencies</h2>
  <p>
	The project consists of a regular Rails application, the dependencies are listed in the Gemfile. 
	The only uncommon thing is the need to use my altered version of 
	<a href="https://github.com/flyerhzm">Richard Huang's gem</a>: 
	<a href="https://github.com/regedor/rails_best_practices/tree/bp_study">rails_best_practices</a>

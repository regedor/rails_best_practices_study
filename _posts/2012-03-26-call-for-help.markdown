Hi everyone, in the present moment, I need a lot of Ruby on Rails applications, 
so that I can use my altered version of the [Richard Huang](https://github.com/flyerhzm) gem: 
[rails_best_practices](https://github.com/regedor/rails_best_practices)
to prove the importance of best practices. 

* I need projects hosted in github.  
* No need for empty rails applications or basic scaffolds.

To help this project you just need to send me a email to miguelregedor[AT]gmail.com) or to add a comment bellow, containing the github link to a rails application 
(maybe a work that you did some time ago). I add some sample comments =)
I would also appreciate if you would write, in the same comment, if consider the source code of that application:

* Gorgeous
* Normal
* Ugly

Thanks in advance for your contribution ;)

<a href="https://github.com/regedor/rails_best_practices">rails_best_practices</a> 
to prove the importance of best practices. 
<ul>
  <li>

  </li><li>
    I don't need empty rails applications or scaffold only applications.
  </li>
</ul>

To help this project you just need to add a comment bellow, containing the github link to a rails application

I would also appreciate if you would write in the same comment if consider the souce code of that application:
<ul>
  <li>
    Gorgeous
  </li><li>
    Normal
  </li><li>
	Ugly
  </li>
</ul>

Thanks in advance for your cooperation ;)

Hi everyone, in the present moment I need a lot of Ruby on Rails applications, 
so that I can use my altered version of the 
<a href="https://github.com/flyerhzm">Richard Huang</a> gem: 
<a href="https://github.com/regedor/rails_best_practices">rails_best_practices</a> 
to prove the importance of best practices. 

<ul><li>
  I need projects hosted in github.  
</li><li>
  No need for empty rails applications or basic scaffolds.
</li></ul>

To help this project you just need to add a comment bellow, containing the github link to a rails application 
(maybe a work that you did some time ago). I add some sample comments =)
I would also appreciate if you would write, in the same comment, if consider the source code of that application:
<ul><li>
  Gorgeous
</li><li>
  Normal
</li><li>
  Ugly
</li></ul>

Thanks in advance for your contribution ;)

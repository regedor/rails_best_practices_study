<h2>Analysing and Measuring Open Source Projects</h2>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
  Thousands of open source software projects are available for collaboration in platforms like Github or Sourceforge.
  However, there is no systematic information about the quality of those projects.
</p>
<p>
  Few users have the ability to assess the quality of a project by looking at source code. 
  An application, able to perform automatic analysis of a software package and to generate a hight level overview of the code,
  would enable users to make better choices about what software to use and help developers by giving hints on how to improve their software.
</p>
<p>
  This paper discusses what should be taken into account when developing such application and what benefits can be expected.

Miguel's paper presented at MI-STAR 2010:

Analysing and Measuring Open Source Projects
--------------------------------------------

### Abstract

Thousands of open source software projects are available for collaboration in platforms like Github or Sourceforge.
However, there is no systematic information about the quality of those projects.

Few users have the ability to assess the quality of a project by looking at source code. 
An application, able to perform automatic analysis of a software package and to generate a hight level overview of the code,
would enable users to make better choices about what software to use and help developers by giving hints on how to improve their software.

This paper discusses what should be taken into account when developing such application and what benefits can be expected.
